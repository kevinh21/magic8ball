                    <br>
                    <p> While businesses are increasingly attentive to the importance of cybersecurity, most are
                        struggling to define and implement the desired security measures, especially in today’s remote
                        working environment. The rapid digital transformation has broadened the attack surface and
                        increased their vulnerability to data breaches. Alongside, as business processes,
                        infrastructure, and data are increasingly moved to the cloud, protecting information and
                        essential infrastructure requires entirely new approaches to enterprise security. With
                        cloud-based threats continuing to grow, organizations struggle to control critical data and
                        ensure real-time threat intelligence. Manual security management isn’t any longer feasible for
                        giant web application infrastructures, forcing businesses to rethink their approach to web
                        application security.
                        To that end, embracing new edge technology and security practices like encryption will
                        drastically reduce the probability and effect of knowledge threats. By incorporating security
                        into agile processes like CI/CD and DevOps, firms can effectively manage risks while maintaining
                        the specified pace and quality of development. Numerous organizations are also aiming for vendor
                        consolidation to streamline operation and reduce costs yet as complexity.
                        With digital transformation ongoing in many organizations, awareness of cybersecurity challenges
                        continues to grow for significant enterprises and tiny businesses. More corporations are coming
                        to understand that having an efficient cybersecurity strategy and cyber incident response plan
                        may be necessary today. Information security training is additionally becoming commonplace for
                        all staff to boost cyber-hygiene and maintain a perfect security posture on all levels of the
                        organization.

                    <p>
                        The company has developed a “quantum-resistant architecture” (QRA) that enables its clients to
                        deploy quantum-resistant cybersecurity solutions at a cost similar to any other contemporary
                        cybersecurity product. Castle Shield’s QRA forms the foundation for all its cybersecurity
                        applications. The security solutions built on QRA can be broadly categorized into three distinct
                        product lines based on their core functions, i.e. encryption, security information event
                        management (SIEM), and regulatory compliance
